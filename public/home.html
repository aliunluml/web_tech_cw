        <p class="intro">
          Future Academic Research is an academic social networking website dedicated to providing an environment inspiring the free exchange of brilliant academic ideas. We give researchers opportunities to share research papers, carry out academic discussion and online peer view, or even produce teaching material using their own research outcomes and launch to the public.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
          We believe Future Academic Research will accelerate the distribution of knowledge among all intellectual individuals, thus inspiring equality, creativity and innovation.

            Post, Like & Comment
          </h5>
          <p class="functionality">
            Similar to other social networking websites, these basic functionalities are available. Here, you can launch your own papers by providing the full version or just the abstract. Also, you can recommend publications of other researchers, e.g. from arXiv.org or Google Scholar.
          </p>
          <p class="functionality">
          On FAR, you can also like or make comments on posts of other researchers. Comments under posts are suggested to be academic-related so that different perspectives can be presented and ensured.

          Academic Discussion
          </h5>
          <p class="functionality">
            Academic discussion is crucial in the exchange of ideas and was traditionally only held in institutions and conferences. Now, we introduce online academic discussion in Future Academic Research.
          </p>
          <p class="functionality">
            You can start a group with a specialisation, in which the latest updates in the field are shared. You can also build a temporary group in which group members can express their different opinions on a specific research outcome or publication--more efficient than conferences and emails.

            Open-Source Education Platform
          </h5>
          <p class="functionality">
            Over time, academic papers and discussions on FAR can also become a precious educational resource. To make full use of these resources, we introduce the open-source platform.
          </p>
          <p class="functionality">
            Researchers can produce their education material (in the form of article, Q&A or video lecture) by using resources from inside or outside of the site. After going through some review processes, the material can then be distributed to the public. Publishers can charge an amount of fee or make the materials free.
